# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸš€ Objective
The goal of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to extract insights, identify patterns, visualize relationships, and understand the structure of the data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
**[Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)** from Kaggle

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard
- Number of Parents/Children aboard

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)
---

The notebook includes:

###  Descriptive Statistics
- Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Min/Max
- Count of missing values

###  Visualizations
- Histograms (for Age, Fare, etc.)
- Boxplots (for detecting outliers)
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot (to examine feature relationships visually)

###  Feature-Level Inferences
